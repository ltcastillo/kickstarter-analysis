Presents a cohesive written analysis that draws three reasonable conclusions from the data and states limitations of the dataset and suggestions for additional tables or graphs.


The Kickstarter Data Set allowed us to draw three reasonable conclusions from the data. May is the month in which the majority of successful Theater kickstarts Launch, Kickstarters with lower goals are more likely to suceed, and Theater Kickstarters tend to be sucessful. 

May is the month that the most kickstarters launch succesfully (93). May, June and July could all be considered succesfull months as they fall within one standard deviation (18.5) of May's success count of 93. It is worth noting however that there are there may be influences not present or calcutaed into the chart above that were included in the data sheet.  These factors included if the kickstarters were labeled as Staff Pick or Spotlight. The effect of these indicators may influence the outcome but that has not been calculated. 
Kickstarters with lower monetary goals tend to be succesful.  The chart above lebeled Outcomes based on Goals combines multiple international currencies and exact dollar amounts vary depending on conversaion rates. However, it can inffered that anything below 5000 in the currencies listed in the data sheet are more likely to be successful. The range of less than 1000 (186 total proects) has the highest percentage success(76%), however the range of 1000 to 4999 with a (73%) has a nearly tripled sample size at 534 kickstarters.
Theater kickstarters have a 67% chance of succeding overall. Once more It is worth noting however that there are there may be influences not present or calcutaed into the chart above that were included in the data sheet.  These factors included if the kickstarters were labeled as Staff Pick or Spotlight. The effect of these indicators may influence the outcome but that has not been calculated. 
For someone trying to succesfully kickstart a campaign for a theater play, despite some unknowns as listed above, it should be recommended that a campain be launched in May with a goal of less than 4999 in their local currency.
